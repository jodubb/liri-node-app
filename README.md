# liri-node-app

This LIRI application utilizes the Spotify, OMDB and Bands in Town API's to grab various information for users depending on their search query. Interested in info on a certain song? Using 'Spotify-this-song <insert song here>' can quickly show you what you need to know straight from your trusted Spotify app. How about your favorite band or performer? Using 'concert-this <insert artist here> can get you on your way to knowing when and where their next performance will take place. And if you're a film buff, you'll find the 'movie-this <insert movie here> command quite helpful in pulling up all the facts and ratings of your movie search.
